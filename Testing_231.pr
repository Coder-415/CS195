/users/abrick/pr/231/2649/4t.py - Wow. Looks like you went above and beyond to test not only the date but also just about everything else. Great job!
/users/abrick/pr/231/2649/k5.py - Good job. Code looks very clean and more than meets the parameter. Liked how you declared time_delta at the start.
/users/abrick/pr/231/2649/69.py - Interesting code. Looks like you checked all of the variables multiple times. Very thorough. 
/users/abrick/pr/231/2649/yz.py - Great code. Very clear and easy to follow. Clearly meets the parameters specified. 
/users/abrick/pr/231/2649/up.py - Works as intended. Code is a little smushed for my personal taste but gets the job done. 
/users/abrick/pr/231/2649/82.py - Nice. Code is well spaced out and easy to follow. Looks like you went above and beyond. Good job! 
/users/abrick/pr/231/2649/4q.py - Sorry, but it does not look as if your code works. Think you accidently commented out the if_name_ section.
