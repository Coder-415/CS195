jz - Perfect. I liked their use of placeholders, citation, and formatting. 
pd - Good, not sure what the -06 and -08 are supposed to indicate. 
8v - Fine, but it should be senator and not senate.
c6 - Great. Liked their use of dividers. Not sure what 12.0:1 is supposed to mean.
ts - Fine, but they should use commas for the numerical values. 
5g - Good, it is very clearly presented but they should use commas for the numerical values.
97 - Incorrect. Failed to grasp the concept and/or answer the question.
