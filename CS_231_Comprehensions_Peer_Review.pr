gn - Wow. Really great. Surprised you were able to do it without using Lambda.
eg - Gets the job done but not pythonic enough. Might have been helpful to have.
ww - Perfect. Liked that you used Lambda. Will try and learn from your example.
9p - Liked that you filtered out the single characters. Good multi-functional use of Lambda.
5v - This is overly complex. Like that you filtered out the single characters. 
et - Did not print out the number. Needed to add a len somewhere.
tj - It looks like you got one too many. Also, think of using Lambda next time.
