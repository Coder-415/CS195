ev - This gets the job done. Technically, mode could also be used to account for strings as well as integers. Appreciate the error proofing.
dm - This works but could use some form of error proofing as opposed to allowing a statistics error to pop up. 
vz - This gets weird results if you only enter in strings. While it should still be accounting for mode, median should not be.
ze - You need some error proofing. Unclear error message pops up if you enter any non-integers into command prompt. 
3v - Appreciate the accounting for multiple modes. You could technically say that strings could also have modes.
fs - I like the setup in terms but it fails to account for bi- or multi-modal arguments.
cp - I appreciate that you account for more than one mode but your code could use error proofing in the event of strings.
