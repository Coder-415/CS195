/users/abrick/pr/231/2650/zi.py - Good program. Wish it allowed for user input. Smart to use .countCalls to return Error. 
/users/abrick/pr/231/2650/mh.py - Would be nice if user input was allowed. Pretty darn concise code. Like your use of exit().
/users/abrick/pr/231/2650/aw.py - Only issue is that it does not allow user input. Code itself works well. Might think of using exit() or error notification.
/users/abrick/pr/231/2650/2s.py - Kind of odd the items you chose to use for your test but works as required. Good use of .calls. 
/users/abrick/pr/231/2650/ip.py - Might be an issue because you are getting errors for calls 1 and 2 despite them being quite long. Code is rather verbose.
/users/abrick/pr/231/2650/63.py - Output is hard to follow due to formatting. Effective code, but it might be improved by use of .countCalls or .calls or exit().
/users/abrick/pr/231/2650/f5.py - Output does not show what was reviewed. Also, not very effective since either 19 characters or error. Basically functions though.
