#Web Service Homework
#Due Date: 11/1/2020


#Task: 
#Write an HTTP service that dynamically acquires a port number 
#and serves a single copy of a memorable text to the first request 
#that comes in. Because of firewall rules, requests to services on 
#high ports running on hills have to come from within the college network


import http.server
import socket

def findport():
	s = socket.socket()
	s.bind(('',0))
	port_num  = s.getsockname()[1]
	s.close()
	return port_num

#Create the handler class to respond to requests 
class Handler(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
	def do_GET(self):
	#200 is the http status code for "OK" -- request succeeded:
		self.send_response(200)
		#Our handler will respond to a request in plain text
		self.send_header('Content-Type','text/plain')
		self.end_headers()
		#Write a file that says 'Hello!' in response to a request:
		self.address_string()
