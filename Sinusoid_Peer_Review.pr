/users/abrick/pr/231/2644/d5.py - Good job. The good is kind of long. Could think about using Lambda. 
/users/abrick/pr/231/2644/sn.py - Really good. Like that you used used map and Lambda. Amazing you got it down to one line.
/users/abrick/pr/231/2644/72.py - Fantastic. Good idea using math.sin and liked that you used lambda. Looks very clean.
/users/abrick/pr/231/2644/8i.py - Works fine. Might be easier to have used math.sin and might not need "." on top of "*".
/users/abrick/pr/231/2644/pp.py - Really good and unique way of doing it. Great job getting it one line. Might look to incorporate map and/or Lambda. 
/users/abrick/pr/231/2644/92.py - Most clear and compex function I have seen so far. Great you were able to get in both one line and used map and Lambda. Amazing! 
/users/abrick/pr/231/2644/fq.py - Probably the most pythonic code that I have seen so far for this assignment. Great use of map and lambda.
