            <h2 id="Art1">History of San Francisco</h2>    
        
            <p> San Francisco was once inhabited by a small native community. At that time, much of it was covered by sand dunes. These early inhabitants are known today as the Ohlone. As a result of contact with Europeans, their population is far smaller than pre-contact.
            </p>
            
            <p>The Spanish arrived in the late 18th century on their way north from what was then known as <em>Nueva Espa&#241;a</em> or New Spain - what is today M&#233;xico. They came up from Mexico to establish a series of forts and evangelical faciliaties known as presidios and missions, respectively. San Francisco was not the first city in California and hardly the most important with Monterey acting as the seat of Spanish and eventually Mexican administration</p>
            
            <p>As a result of the Meixcan-American War of the 1840s, California and what is today the American South-West was ceded to the United States of America. Shortly thereafter, gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill and the Gold Rush of 1849 began. This lured 10,000s of prospectors, known as 49s, to the state and specifically to San Francisco which became a boom town. While the city of San Francisco has had its ups and downs, most infamously the Great Fire of 1906, it quickly became a center of finance and one of the leading cities on the West Coast. Starting in the late 20th century, the San Francisco Bay Region, owing to its educated populace and high-technology manufacturing industry, became home to Silicon Valley. This lead to further prosperity for the region and the Bay Area remains a global leader in technology. </p>
