        <h1>History of San Francisco</h1>
        
            <p>San Francisco was settled 1,000s of years ago by hunter gathers. The people who once inhabitated this land were known as the Miwok. They used to number in the 1,000s, if not 10,000s, in the Bay Area. With the advent of the Europeans, they largely vanished due to a host of factors. We recognize their ancestral heritage to this land.</p>
                
                
            <p>San Francisco was established by the Spanish in the late 18th century in part to counter the moving southward of Russian interests as evidenced by the establishment of Fort Ross. Until the Gold Rush, San Francisco was a small village. With the Gold Rush begun in 1848, the population exploded. By the late 19th century, San Francisco was established as one of the leading urban centers west of the Mississippi</p>
