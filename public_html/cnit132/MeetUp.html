    <h1>Python SEO: How To Use Python To Help With SEO</h1>
    
    <p>This MeetUp occured on November 18, 2021. It was hosted by the <a href = "https://www.meetup.com/Digital-Marketing-Quarterly/" target="_blank">Digital Marketing Quarterly MeetUp group</a> based out of Vancouver, WA. This was their first meeting since the pandemic. However, the group used to have meetings regularly and plans to resume hosting quarterly meetings from here on out.</p>
        
    <p>This meetings was, as the name implies, on utilizing the software programming language Python to aid in Search Enginge Optimization (SEO), especially as it relates to digital marketing. I learned a lot from this session such as examples of the ways Python can serve to support SEO and digital marketing.</p>
    
    <p>List of ways in which Python can help with digital marketing:</p>

            <li>SEO Forecasting</li>
            <li>Merging and Blending Data</li>

        </ul>
