            <h2>Overview</h2>
            
            <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a commonly used term in the website development industry to describe the process by which websites are designed to be more likely to come up near the top of search browsers' results when individuals search for a related term. Having one's website pop up at the top of search results is critical for ensuring the success of any website. Very few people will go beyond the first page when searching for something on a search browser such as Google and many will not even bother to scroll down to the bottom of the first page if a meaningful result pops up near the top of the list. There are a number of tips that developers can implement to enhance the effectiveness of their website's SEO.</p>

            <ul>
        
                <li>Be thoughtful in choosing a title that is relevant to your audience and the terms they are likely to be searching for</li>
                <li>Utilize meta tags extensively to describe your website</li>
                <li>Be thorough in identifying any and all relevant keywords - the more the merrier</li>
                <li>Make sure to include keywords extensively in meta tags, headings, and titles</li>
                <li>Avoid free webhosting sites if you are trying to attract traffic</li>
                <li>Ensure that your website is well coded by validating it, ensuring appropriate use of headings, and removing all broken links</li>
                <li>Include alt tags and descriptions for all pictures - this also enhances accessibility</li>
                <li>Direct as much traffic as you can to your site by, for example, making social media posts with links to your site and asking your network to share your website</li>
                <li>Place a formatted xml file with a site map on your site to help search engine crawlers find what pages are present and what have recently changed, and to crawl your site accordingly - these organize your website and identify the URLs and data under each section.</li>
