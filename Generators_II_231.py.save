#Write a program to lazily rewrap text from the filename passed so that it fits an 80 column window without breaking any words. Use a generator that yields the next lines of text, each containing as many words as possible.

#Think, what does this mean? 1.) What does he mean by lazily - does not construct an in-memory list, i.e., uses generator. 
#We want to import text. We want to apply a generator to it. This will mean that it will process one line each time called because iterator. 
#The function should recognize each word in the line and cut off iterate when word would get line past 80 characters. It will add this word to the next line.
